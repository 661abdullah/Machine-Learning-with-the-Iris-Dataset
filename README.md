# Project T5: Exploring Machine Learning with the Iris Dataset

Welcome to my GitHub repository for Project T5, where I delve into machine learning using the renowned Iris dataset. This project is a comprehensive exploration of both unsupervised and supervised learning techniques.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: I begin by loading and examining the Iris dataset, preparing it thoroughly for the machine learning tasks ahead.
- **Unsupervised Learning**: I utilize K-means clustering to find patterns and employ Isolation Forest to detect outliers in the data.
- **Supervised Learning**: The project also involves developing a baseline model and assessing its effectiveness.
- **Model Comparison**: I compare various machine learning algorithms to determine which performs best with this dataset.

## Setup

Make sure to install Python libraries like `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`, which are essential for data manipulation and visualization in this project.

## How to Use This Notebook

- **Task 1**: Start with data preprocessing to ensure the dataset is ready for modeling.
- **Task 2**: Apply clustering and outlier detection methods to understand the underlying patterns.
- **Task 3 & 4**: Train and evaluate different models to identify the optimal approach.
